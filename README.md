**Dust and Stone - Surviving in a hostile world**

The year is 4135, you are a lone survivor of a large war between the villagers and the illagers, which led to the latter's victory,  plunging the world into corruption and disarray. Nature has reclaimed sprawling cities, zombies of various types inhabit. Will you perish, or will you provide?

* A harder start!
* Choose what to carry carefully! Without a backpack your inventory hardly hold anything
* Loot the abandoned cities to find basic supplies
* Build up a fortification to shield yourself from the dangerous night and power it with Thermal Expansion and ComputerCraft technology
* Forge alliances and make enemies, you're not the only survivor, and some of them want your stuff!
* Utilize fully-customizable and enchantable firearms to defend against the hoards of monsters and your fellow humans.
* Make sure to stay rested! Your body is as fragile as ever and you'll need to stay warm, well nourished, and rested.
* A hardcore health system that will make you rethink how you approach problems and combat
